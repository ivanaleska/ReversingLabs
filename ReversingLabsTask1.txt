Next-Level Threat Analysis: Fast, Scalable, and Business-Driven Security Solutions

TitaniumCore performs advanced file analysis with millisecond response times, powered by a high-performance engine built to scaleâ€”from analyzing just a few files to billions each day. Its flexibility supports a broad range of applications, making it ideal for organizations of any size or need.
The built-in rules engine assigns threat levels using both ReversingLabs-provided rules and customer-supplied YARA rules. Extracted files can be automatically routed to additional analysis tools, including decompilers, debuggers, sandboxes, and virtual machine (VM) environments, for deeper inspection. Security analysts can further investigate threats based on severity and type, enabling faster, more informed decisions while maximizing the efficiency of existing security resources. 
TitaniumCore delivers unmatched scalability for deploying systems that analyze and report on large volumes of files. No other solution, including sandboxes and scanners, matches TitaniumCore in the depth and breadth of threat intelligence it reveals.
